The structure of the banking application is designed to separate concerns and facilitate easy maintenance. Here’s an overview of the key components:

Source Code (src/): This is where the core application logic resides. It is divided into several subdirectories:

Controllers: These handle the incoming requests from users. Each controller manages a specific aspect of the application, such as user accounts, transactions, or beneficiary management. They process data and interact with models to perform operations like creating accounts or processing transfers.
Models: These define the data structures and interact with the database. Models represent entities such as users, transactions, and beneficiaries, and include methods for querying and updating this data.
Routes: This directory contains route definitions that map HTTP requests to specific controller actions. It organizes how different endpoints (e.g., /user/register, /transaction/transfer) are handled by the application.
Services: Services encapsulate business logic that doesn't fit neatly into controllers or models. They might handle complex operations or interactions with external systems.
Utils: Utility functions and helpers that are used across various parts of the application, such as formatting data or handling authentication.


Unit Tests: Test individual functions or components to ensure they work as expected in isolation.
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between different modules, ensuring that combined parts of the application function correctly together.
End-to-End Tests: Simulate real-world scenarios to ensure that the entire application works as expected from the user's perspective.

Purpose of Each Module
Controllers: Act as intermediaries between the user and the application’s core logic. They handle requests, invoke appropriate services, and send responses back to the user. For instance, the UserController handles user-related operations like registration and login.

Models: Define the schema and structure for data stored in the database. They include operations for querying and updating data. For example, the AccountModel manages details related to user accounts and transactions.

Routes: Define how HTTP requests are mapped to the application's functionality. They ensure that incoming requests are routed to the correct controllers and actions, such as handling a money transfer request or retrieving transaction history.

Services: Encapsulate complex business logic and interactions with external systems. They might handle tasks like processing transactions or integrating with third-party services for additional functionality.

Utils: Provide common functions and helpers that can be reused across the application. They simplify tasks such as data validation, formatting, and error handling.

3. Testing Strategy
Unit Testing: Focuses on individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly in isolation. For example, testing a function that calculates transaction fees ensures it handles various scenarios accurately.

Integration Testing: Ensures that different modules or components work together correctly. For example, testing the integration between the user authentication module and the transaction processing module.

End-to-End Testing: Simulates real user interactions with the application to ensure that it performs as expected in a real-world environment. This might involve testing user workflows such as registering an account, making a transfer, and checking transaction history.

The testing strategy includes using tools and frameworks suited for each type of test, ensuring comprehensive coverage and reliable application performance.
